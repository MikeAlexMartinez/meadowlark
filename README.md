This repository is being used while I work through O'Reilly's Web Development with Node And Express book. 
As I encounter problems in the book I may amend code from the book or use different solutions to solve the problems
the book is trying to solve.

For example, instead of Zombie js for cross page testing I've used casperjs.

More than anything this is a learning exercise to help me get better acquainted with both the use of github 
and Node/Express in more detail before I begin my own web project.
